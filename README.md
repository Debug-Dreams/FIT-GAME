### Problem Statement
- Children nowadays are constantly engrossed in video games and usually, they use their phones for the same which impacts their health negatively.Just sitting in one place and playing games for a long time restricts the physical movement of people and makes them lethargic as well. Often this leads to some adverse consequences such as weakening of muscles and thus proves to be a poor resort to enjoyment.
- People nowadays have terribly hectic schedules, they don’t have time to go to the gym. Physical Inactivity can lead to both physical as well as mental diseases.

### Objective and Solution

We have planned to create a gamified fitness platform in order to help the user enjoy games and maintain good health at the same time. Our project idea is to provide a fitness experience that is gamified. We will mainly implement our project in python using machine learning. The game would require users to run and jump as well as do physical exercises in real life in order for their avatar in the game to imitate the motion and move on the screen. To motivate the users, we are planning to give rewards on multiple levels. For example, every n number of situps will be rewarded with a prize or we can even activate the lives to play the game only after the user performs some fitness moves. So, the overall motive is to combine fitness with fun.

### Existing Solutions in the Market

Most of the existing solutions in the market are:
- Not children friendly and cater only to the needs of Adults
- Encourage Participation with a leaderboard to compare progress with friends where leaderboards are based on the number of calories burned and not points gained by playing a game.
- Do not have an option of actual game playing while exercising in real-time and being active.

### How is this Different

### TechStack

- Step 1 Creating The Model
Firstly, We will use Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning for training our model and capturing real-time gestures. We will use different libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, MediaPipe for this purpose.

- Step 2 Implementing The Model
We will create a game to implement our model. We will use Scratch for creating this game and we will integrate our python model with this game.

### Implementation

- As soon as the user would enter the platform, he/she will be given some fitness tasks on the completion of which the user would earn some points and unlock the lives to play the game. 
On entering the game the user will have to move in real life so as to have the avatar imitate the user on the screen. The user's real-time video will be recorded and his/her actions will be recognized through python, machine learning, deep learning, and some libraries like Tensor flow, Open CV, Media pipe. The recognized actions will be converted to actions of the avatar and would be replicated on the screen (in the game).
- A leader board will be displayed which will motivate users to complete more challenges and earn Fit-Game badges

### Future Scope
- With growing concerns about children's health and the addictive nature of video games, we need a solution that incorporates both enjoyment and health.
- Following the Covid-19 pandemic, the use of video and mobile games has skyrocketed, wreaking havoc on people's health.
- So we can confidently state that this application has a bright future ahead of it and a noble goal of getting our children back in shape.
